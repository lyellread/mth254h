Chapter: 11.2

Definitions
Vector Notation in 2D: vec(v) = <x1,x2> = x1*i + x2*j
Vector Notation in 3D: vec(v) = <x1, x2, x3> = x1*i + x2*j + x3*k
2D Unit Vector i: <1,0>
2D Unit Vector j: <0,1>
3D Unit Vector i: <1,0,0>
3D Unit Vector j: <0,1,0>
3D Unit Vector k: <0,0,1>
Euclidian Coordinates: AKA Rectangular Coordinates, (x,y) is in "R"^2

Concepts
2D Constraints: If you have the set {(x,y): x=a} then that set is the line x=a; with the set {(x,y):x=a, y=b} that is a point (a,b). With the set {(x,y):x=a or y=b}: That is two lines that intersect at (a,b)
3D Constraints: If you have the set {(x,y,z): y=a}, then that is a plane. With two constraints (i.e. <var>=a) that is a line (the intersection of two planes) and with an 'or' it is actually two plains. With three constraints, that is a point.
3D Vector Length: vec(p) = <p1, p2, p3> ; |vec(p)| = SQRT(p1^2 + p2^2 + p3^2)
Circle Magic: For a circle with Radius 1 at O: [1] all points on that circle have coords (rcosTHETA,rsinTHETA) [2] the arc length from 1,0 to the point on the circle os equivalent to THETA (S=rTHETA). 
Polar Coordinates: x=rcosTHETA, y=rsinTHETA, r=|<x,y>|, THETA=Angle to <x,y>
